    <p>The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne, based on the earlier film 
        of the same name. It is based on the belief of the pseudoscientific law of attraction,
         which claims that thought alone can influence objective circumstances within ones life .
         [1][2] The book alleges energy as assurance of its effectiveness. 
         The book has sold 30 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 50 languages. 
         Scientific claims made in the book have been rejected
         by a range of critics, pointing out that the book has no scientific foundation.

           US TV host Oprah Winfrey is a proponent of the book. On The Larry King Show
           she said that the message of The Secret is the message she's been
            trying to share with the world on her show for the past 21 years.
            [13] Author Rhonda Byrne was later invited to her show along with people
             who swear by The Secret.[14]

          Valerie Frankel of Good Housekeeping wrote an article about her trying
           the principles of The Secret for four weeks. While she reached some
            of her goals, others had not improved. Frankel's final assessment is:
             "Counting my blessings has been uplifting, reminding me of what's
              already great about my life. Visualization has forced me to pay
               attention to what I really desire. And laughing is never a bad idea.
                If you ignore The Secret's far-too-simplistic maxims 
                (no, you will not be doomed to a miserable life for thinking negative
                 thoughts) and the hocus-pocus (the cosmos isn't going to deliver 
                 a new car; it's busy), there's actually some helpful advice in the book. 
                 But it's nothing you don't already know."[15]
          
          In 2009, Barbara Ehrenreich published Bright-Sided: 
          How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined
           America as a reaction to self-help books such as The Secret, 
           claiming that they promote political complacency and a failure
            to engage with reality.[16][17]
          
          Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,
           is one of the harshest critics,[citation needed] writing that the
            book is "full of misplaced clichés, silly quotes, 
            and superstitious drivel," and calls it a "playbook for entitlement 
            and self-absorption," which "anybody who reads it and implements 
            its advice ... will likely make themselves worse off in the long run.</p>

        <p>The Secret was released as a film in March 2006, and later the same year as a book.
             The book is influenced by Wallace Wattles' 1910 book The Science of Getting Rich,
             [5] which Byrne received from her daughter during a time of personal trauma, 
             in 2004.[6] New York Times bestselling authors of The Passion Test, 
             Janet Bray Attwood and Chris Attwood, are not featured in the film or the book, 
             but arranged 36 of the 52 interviews for the film, 
             many of which are referenced in the book.[7]

            The book served as the basis for the 2020 film The Secret:
             Dare to Dream.[8]
